A way to inform farmers about weather using Twilio's SMS service

Currently, the project has a few components. 

1) Send the SMS -> send_sms.py
2) Collect the weather data with REST API -> weatherData.py


Next:

3) I want to explore a way to create a ML framework that will read the weather data then determine if changes occur in the    weather such as higher likelyhood of rain or not rain. This would make an automated call to the weather api for x region by the minute and then determine if the changes are drastic enough to inform the farmer via text message. 
4) I want a way so farmers can sign up via text message. {e.g.: "Text 9134323444 to sign up." }
5) A way to determine crop yields.
